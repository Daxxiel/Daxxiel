- 👋 Hi, I’m @Daxxiel, or you can call me Mark. I am 24, soon 25, from Hungary.
- 👀 I’m interested in how to apply computer science in various scientific fields, how to make sci-fi and fantasy real. I love video games, anime, languages and learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer science in ELTE - Budapest, and in my freetime I am learning about...well, almost everything that comes next to me. The world is full of wonderful things.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are connected with psychology and modelling the human mind.
- 📫 You can reach me here, mainly. I am not a fan of social media/IMS, I do not want to be avaiable all the time.
